# Intro

- Chainlink allows for smart contract customisation.
- Ethereum takes store of digital value up a level by allowing for smart contracts and using Oracles to utilise off-chain computation via something like chainlink.
- Individuals are known as node operators within a blockchain
- Lack of centralised entities prevents people from controlling things like market - eg. Robinhood blocking GME stocks
- Everything that happens on chain can be seen, everyone is on the same level. There are no admin privilliges. Totally transparent.
- Blockchains are immutable meaning they cannot be changed or tampered with. If all your data is on a blockchain, it's ok as long as one node on the system is running, your system is secure.
- Utilising a blockchain removes the counterparty risk, meaning that conflicts-of-interest can be prevented - eg. for insurance companies, they don't want to pay out even if you already paid in.
- Allows us to engage in trustless agreements, or trust minimised agreements. We move from "brand based" to "math based" agreements - whatever code determines, we go by.
- Blockchain is faster than most legacy banking systems.
- You can use a testnet that emulates eth but it is all dummy. 
- Gas refers to the fee paid to the node operators 
- Gas prices will fluctuate depending on how many people are using it.
- You can pay a premium to have it completed quicker.
- Hash is a unique fixed length string that identifies a piece of data, created by placing data into a hash function
